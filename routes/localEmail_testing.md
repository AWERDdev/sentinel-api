## 🚨 Local Development & Email Testing Notes (Resend API)

When testing the Canary Token trigger system locally on `localhost`, you may encounter an **HTTP 403 / Domain Restriction** error from the Resend API. 

### Why this happens:
By default, unverified free-tier Resend accounts operate under a strict sandbox mode. Resend will prevent emails from being delivered to arbitrary domains/addresses until you verify a custom domain via DNS records.

### How to test locally without a custom domain:
To successfully receive breach notification emails during local manual testing:
1. Ensure the email address you pass in your configuration payload matches the **exact email address you used to sign up for your Resend account**.
2. Alternatively, hardcode your Resend registration email into the `to` field of the `send_security_alert` function within `routes/canary_trigger.py` temporarily for testing.

Once the application is deployed to production with a verified custom domain, alerts can be dynamically routed to any user-specified email.
